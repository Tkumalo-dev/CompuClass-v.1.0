# CompuClass v1.0 — Codebase Context

## Overview

CompuClass is a React Native / Expo mobile app (iOS + Android) for teaching computer hardware to students. It has two user roles: **student** and **lecturer**. The backend is **Supabase** (Postgres + Auth + Storage). AI features use **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**.

## Authentication & App Flow (App.js)

The app has three top-level states managed in `AppContent`:

1. **Onboarding** (`isFirstLaunch = true`) → `OnboardingScreen`
2. **Auth** (`isLoggedIn = false`) → `LoginScreen` / `SignUpScreen` / `ForgotPasswordScreen`
3. **Main app** (`isLoggedIn = true`) → Tab navigator

On startup, `checkUser()` calls `supabase.auth.getSession()`. If a valid session exists, it fetches the user profile and sets `userRole` (`student` or `lecturer`).

The tab bar is a **custom floating pill** (`CustomTabBar`) with 4 visible tabs. Hidden tabs (PC Lab, Windows 11, Quiz, Troubleshoot, Materials, Settings, Chatbot) are navigated to via the sidebar or dashboard cards.

The **sidebar** (`Sidebar.js`) slides in from the left — triggered by the header menu button or a right-swipe gesture (disabled on PC Lab screen).

---

## User Roles

### Student
- Default role assigned on signup
- Tab bar: Home (Dashboard), Search, Profile
- Can access: PC Lab, Quiz, Troubleshooting, Materials, Windows 11 Simulator, Chatbot, Settings

### Lecturer
- Assigned if email is `lecturer@compuclass.com` OR set manually in DB
- Tab bar: Lecturer (replaces Home), Search, Profile
- Can access: Lecturer Dashboard, Folder management, Content upload, Quiz creation, Class management, Student progress

Role is determined by `profiles.role` in Supabase, set via the `handle_new_user` trigger on signup.

## Services

### `authService.js`
- `signIn(email, password)` — Supabase email/password auth
- `signUp(email, password, fullName, role)` — creates auth user + profile via DB trigger
- `signOut()` — clears Supabase session + AsyncStorage
- `getCurrentUser()` — gets auth user + joins `profiles` table
- `getOfflineUser()` — reads cached user from AsyncStorage
- `isSessionValid()` — checks 30-minute session window in AsyncStorage
- `resetPassword(email)` — sends Supabase reset email
- `updateProfile(fullName, avatarFile)` — updates auth metadata + `profiles` table + uploads avatar to Storage
- `updatePassword(currentPassword, newPassword)` — Supabase `updateUser`

### `lecturerService.js`
Covers all lecturer CRUD operations:
- **Folders**: `createFolder`, `getFolders`, `deleteFolder`
- **Documents**: `uploadDocument` (to Supabase Storage + DB), `getDocuments`, `deleteDocument`
- **Quizzes**: `createQuiz`, `getQuizzes`, `getQuizDetail`, `deleteQuiz`, `shareQuizToClasses`
- **Classes**: `createClass`, `getClasses`, `getClassDetail`, `assignStudentsToClass`, `getClassStudents`, `removeStudentFromClass`
- **Students**: `getStudents` (via RPC `get_students_with_emails`), `addStudent`, `getStudentProgress`, `getStudentDetail`
- **AI**: `generateAIQuiz(file, title, questionCount)` — delegates to `aiService`

### `aiService.js`
Uses Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (`EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY`):
- `generateQuizFromFile(file, title, questionCount)` — routes to PDF or text path
- `generateQuizFromPDF(file, title, questionCount)` — sends base64 PDF inline to Gemini
- `generateQuizFromText(text, title, questionCount)` — sends extracted text to Gemini
- `extractTextFromFile(file)` — reads file as string via `expo-file-system`
- `chatWithAI(messages)` — multi-turn chat with CompuBot system prompt

### `gamificationservice.js`
Thin wrapper over the gamification RPCs. Every method swallows errors and
returns a zeroed default, so Dashboard and Profile render 0 XP / Level 1 rather
than crashing if the backend is unavailable:
- `getMyStats()` — `get_my_stats` RPC → xp, level, current_streak, longest_streak, xp_for_current_level, xp_for_next_level
- `getMyBadges()` — `get_my_badges` RPC → earned badges
- `getLeaderboard(classId = null)` — `get_leaderboard` RPC; null classId means global scope

Note: quiz submission and grading do **not** go through this service — `QuizScreen`
calls `submit_quiz_attempt` and `get_quiz_questions_for_attempt` directly, and
`lecturerService.createQuiz` calls `set_question_gamification_settings`.

### `offlineService.js`
SQLite-backed offline cache (singleton `OfflineService` class):
- Tables: `courses`, `quiz_results`, `user_progress`
- `saveCourse`, `getCourses`, `saveQuizResult`
- `syncPendingData()` — pushes unsynced quiz results to Supabase when back online
- Network listener via `@react-native-community/netinfo`

## Database Schema (Supabase)

### Tables

| Table | Key Columns |
|---|---|
| `profiles` | `id` (FK auth.users), `full_name`, `role` (student/lecturer) |
| `folders` | `id`, `name`, `description`, `lecturer_id` |
| `documents` | `id`, `title`, `file_url`, `file_name`, `file_type`, `file_size`, `folder_id`, `lecturer_id` |
| `quizzes` | `id`, `title`, `description`, `passing_score` (default 70), `folder_id`, `lecturer_id` |
| `quiz_questions` | `id`, `quiz_id`, `question`, `options` (JSONB), `correct_answer`, `order_index` |
| `classes` | `id`, `name`, `description`, `lecturer_id` |
| `class_students` | `class_id`, `student_id`, `joined_at` (unique pair) |
| `quiz_assignments` | `quiz_id`, `class_id` (unique pair) |
| `quiz_attempts` | `id`, `user_id`, `quiz_id`, `score` (percentage), `completed_at` |
| `material_views` | `id`, `user_id`, `document_id`, `created_at` |

### Gamification (`gamification` schema)

Gamification lives in its own Postgres schema, not in `public`. Captured in
`supabase-setup.sql` section 9.

| Table | Key Columns |
|---|---|
| `gamification.user_stats` | `user_id` (PK, FK profiles), `xp`, `level`, `current_streak`, `longest_streak`, `last_activity_date` |
| `gamification.badges` | `id`, `code` (unique), `name`, `description`, `icon` — 6 seeded rows |
| `gamification.user_badges` | `id`, `user_id`, `badge_id`, `earned_at`, unique on (user_id, badge_id) |
| `gamification.quiz_question_settings` | `question_id` (PK, FK quiz_questions), `time_limit_seconds`, `difficulty` (easy/medium/hard) |
| `gamification.quiz_attempt_stats` | `id`, `attempt_id` (unique, FK quiz_attempts), `xp_earned`, `max_combo`, `correct_count`, `total_questions` |

`public.quiz_attempts` is deliberately left at its original shape — extended
per-attempt stats go in `gamification.quiz_attempt_stats`, joined on `attempt_id`.

RLS is enabled on all five. `user_stats` and `user_badges` allow the owner to
SELECT, `badges` is world-readable. `quiz_question_settings` and
`quiz_attempt_stats` have **no policies at all** — deliberate deny-all, since
every read and write goes through the SECURITY DEFINER functions below.

Badge codes: `first_quiz`, `perfect_score`, `streak_3`, `streak_7`, `combo_5`,
`quiz_master`.

XP model: base XP per correct answer scales with difficulty — easy 5, medium 10,
hard 15 — multiplied by a combo multiplier (+0.2× every 3 consecutive correct,
capped at 2.0×), +5 if answered with over half the time limit remaining, +20 for
finishing, +50 more at 90%+. Level N requires `100 * N * (N+1) / 2` total XP
(`xp_to_level`).

Medium is the default for any question without a `quiz_question_settings` row,
so quizzes authored before difficulty existed pay exactly what they always did.
The base-XP values are duplicated in `QuizScreen`'s `DIFFICULTY` map to label
each question in the UI — if you change one, change the other.

**Retry policy:** a quiz is worth its best-ever attempt, *once*. Each submission
is valued on its own, then only the improvement over the user's previous best on
that quiz is added to their total — beating your best pays the difference,
matching or falling short pays nothing. `quiz_attempt_stats.xp_earned` stores
the attempt's own value (not the awarded amount), which is what makes the
high-water mark work. `submit_quiz_attempt` returns `xp_earned` (what landed),
`xp_attempt_value`, `xp_previous_best` and `is_personal_best` so the UI can
explain a zero-XP retake. Badge counts use `COUNT(DISTINCT quiz_id)`, so
retaking one quiz ten times does not unlock `quiz_master`.

| RPC | Called from | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `submit_quiz_attempt(p_quiz_id, p_answers)` | `QuizScreen` | Grades the attempt server-side; returns score, passed, correct_count, total_questions, xp_earned, max_combo, current_streak, leveled_up, new_level, new_badges[], review[] |
| `get_quiz_questions_for_attempt(p_quiz_id)` | `QuizScreen` | Returns questions **without** `correct_answer` so answers can't be read from the network response |
| `get_my_stats()` | `gamificationservice` | xp, level, streaks, level thresholds |
| `get_my_badges()` | `gamificationservice` | Badges earned by the current user |
| `get_leaderboard(p_class_id)` | `gamificationservice` | Rankings; null class id = global |
| `set_question_gamification_settings(p_question_id, p_time_limit_seconds, p_difficulty)` | `lecturerService.createQuiz` | Per-question timer and difficulty |

Two more functions support these: `xp_to_level(xp)` (the level curve) and
`custom_access_token_hook(event)`, which injects `profiles.role` into the JWT.

⚠️ **The auth hook needs manual setup.** Running `supabase-setup.sql` creates
`custom_access_token_hook` but cannot activate it — it must also be registered
in the dashboard under **Authentication → Hooks → Custom Access Token**. Miss
that step on a fresh project and role claims silently never appear in the JWT.

A trigger `on_profile_created_init_stats` on `public.profiles` calls
`gamification.handle_new_profile()` to create each user's `user_stats` row, so
the signup chain is: `auth.users` insert → `handle_new_user()` → profile row →
this trigger → `user_stats` row.

### RLS Summary
- Students can only read/write their own data
- Lecturers can manage their own folders, documents, quizzes, classes
- Everyone can view documents and quizzes (open read)
- `get_students_with_emails()` — SECURITY DEFINER RPC to expose student emails to lecturers

### Trigger
`handle_new_user()` fires `AFTER INSERT ON auth.users` → inserts into `profiles`. Sets role to `lecturer` if email is `lecturer@compuclass.com`, otherwise `student`.

### Storage
Single public bucket: `documents` — used for both course files and user avatars.

## Design System

All colors are defined as local constants in each file (no shared theme file used in practice):

| Token | Hex |
|---|---|
| Primary Blue | `#2563EB` |
| Yellow / Secondary | `#FACC15` |
| Red / Danger | `#EF4444` |
| Green / Success | `#22C55E` |
| Purple | `#8B5CF6` |
| Background | `#F3F4F6` |
| Surface / Card | `#FFFFFF` |
| Text Primary | `#111827` |
| Text Muted | `#4B5563` |
| Border | `#E5E7EB` |

`ThemeContext` exists but dark mode is stubbed — `toggleTheme` is a no-op and both `lightTheme` and `darkTheme` export the same `appTheme` object.

Haptics (`expo-haptics`) are used throughout for button presses and feedback. Animated spring/sequence used for card press animations and sidebar transitions.

---

## Known Issues & Notes

- **`supabase-setup.sql` has never been run end-to-end against a fresh project.** Section 9 was reconstructed from the live database rather than written first, so while it matches what's deployed, the full script's ordering has not been verified on an empty database.
- **The custom access token hook needs a manual dashboard step** after running the SQL — see the Gamification section above.
- **Dark mode** is scaffolded but not implemented — `toggleTheme` does nothing.
- `offlineService` is initialized but not actively called from most screens — it's a background sync utility.
- `useOffline` hook is imported in `App.js` but `isOnline` is not currently used to gate any UI.
- `StudentMaterialsScreen`, `Windows11SimulatorScreen`, `OnboardingScreen`, `SignUpScreen`, `ForgotPasswordScreen`, `QuizCreationScreen`, `ContentUploadScreen`, `FolderContentScreen`, `ClassManagementScreen`, `ClassDetailScreen`, `QuizDetailScreen`, `StudentProgressScreen` were not fully read — their internal logic follows the same patterns as the screens documented above.
- The lecturer role trigger only auto-assigns `lecturer` for the hardcoded email `lecturer@compuclass.com`. All other signups become `student` regardless of the `role` field passed in `signUp()`.
